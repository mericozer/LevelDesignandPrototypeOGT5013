# LevelDesignandPrototypeOGT5013
Small level design project using Unity's Terrain Toolbox for Game Development Concepts course. Level is based on simply showing the terrain area like grass, sand, stones. Also you can control a character which changes when you use 1 and 2 buttons. You can slay the skeleton enemies at the castle to finish the level.
